* Short discussion about the goals of the group for reference

* Matt B brought up the idea of building better frameworks for serverless,
  discussion
  * One suggestion was to do some type of comparison of different methods by
    writing the same app in multiple frameworks such as arc.codes
  * Someone commented it is hard to compete against frameworks which have a
    history of doing these things over the past 20 years
  * A mention of Ben Kehoe's comment that using existing frameworks leads to
    monolithic apps
  * One way to build some form of a framework is to write small wrappers that
    are an abstraction around products like API gateway
  * There is also the potential lambda team will expose the Lambda
    request/response model eventually anyway which might make these frameworks
    unnecessary

* Michael commented that someone who works at Stedi wrote a Go module that
  allows you to do cleanup just before lambda is shutdown 
  * This module would return response back to client - he did it in such a way
    that didn't require a lambda extension - not portable to other languages
  * We might want to talk to lambda team about things like how to make lifecycle
    hooks without extensions - don't want to make response time slower while
    doing cleanup - Lambda lifecycle hooks has a lot of potential

  * Original conversation on Lambda lifecycle hooks and signals between Heitor Lessa (@heitor_lessa) and Harold Sun (@sunhua)
    * [Original tweet](https://twitter.com/heitor_lessa/status/1486641301403619329) from Heitor.
    * Example from [Aidan Steele](https://twitter.com/__steele/status/1502061328646942722) at Stedi (@__steele).
    * Aidan has github repo [here](https://github.com/aidansteele/postinvoke) for PostInvoke for Go.

* Matt M said it would be a good project for this group to work on to compare
  multiple frameworks and provide suggestions to adopters
  * Identify things that works nicely together - give feedback to lambda team

* Thought that if the Lambda team did this, they might provide a solution where
  pre and post hooks might have timeout (i.e 2 seconds) to limit lifecycle
  lifetime

* Michael B has talked to Lambda team about pre stuff for Java and it has been
  improving - even Python has capability to improve speed of cold starts
  * maybe they could work with Python community to improve speed, Michael thinks
    theoretically a large improvement since everyone already knows Python has
    slow coldstart time

* exciting things would be pre-init stuff in future - offload things you do in
  your lambda if you could do it in pre-init for (almost) free you could
  hibernate things and gain benefits in cold starts

* Matt M - Nodejs 16 performance benchmarking - SDK if you understand well you
  can optimize for your use case - wants to shed light on it needs to focus on
  presenting it well
  * for example if using xray to instrument sdk 3 is way faster than sdk 2

* Michael - for example in Java one thing you shouldn't do is optimize compiler
  flags prematurely, vendors are all different

* Nodejs 18 - the rumor is they will put sdk v3 in runtime

* Matt M: good idea to have article to cover Nodejs 18 when SDK is in the
  runtime - how to convert from Nodejs 16 when it was only in SDK, some folks
  will have a hard time managing this switch

* One problem (or observation) for Lambda is that SDKs are not written for
  Lambda, they're general purpose and not optomized for these short lived Lambda
  functions
  * Expensive setup scaffolding in the SDK but if there was a focus on
    shortening SDK launch it would be a better experience in Lambdas
  * Python is similar, they took the approach of using a very clever way to
    write the interface, but that impacts size of the library and performance:
    boto is too large 150MB because it includes everything

* Lambda might also include other dependencies by default like jquery library -
  what happens if they remove that dependency and you don't have what you expect
  in your function

* Michael SDK team has to work on this in general this is a problem for all
  languages and SDKs

* Matt M - one thought is we should share some of this discussion - build a
  couple of apps, show comprises Lambda developers need to make, accompany with
  a blog post and then share a twitter space to talk about optimizing the
  runtime

* Matt B - building on Matt M's idea, we could spearhead a collaborative effort
  to write a blog series on these topics too

* We could write an application in our Serverless Community Projects Github org
  with some thoughts on optimizing these things and discussing the options

* Todo item: Matt B
  * open project -
    * build sample app
    * discuss optimization decisions made and tradefoffs required
    * write blog post
    * twitter space

* Jones commented in chat: One app in various languages/framework like sample
  app in Python vs NodeJS vs Java puts forth an awesome comparison for folks to
  say what works best with different scenarios. There could be folks who can
  build it on different frameworks SAM / CDK / Serverless comparison also.

* Comment that the cost comparison between serverless, k8s, openshift, on prem
  * people don't necessarily understand all the nuances of each
  * comparing where serverless is more expensive but if you include everything
  it becomes cheaper
  * ec2 compute might get cheaper switching to arm

* cloud native problem of dealing with secrets - IAM is easier to manage fine
  grained controls

* if you use the right abstractions you can build a story of how these things
  look

* (Anecdotes about security and scaling and timeouts and lift/shift)

* Quick discussion about Codebuild/Codepipeline complexity vs CircleCI/GHA - the
  yaml is so easy for the incumbents such as Circle/GHA and for AWS
  Codebuild/Codepipeline its a missed opportunity

* discussion which companies are adopting serverless - companies that have been
  around for a while and need to make massive changes because problems they've
  encountered

* Thibault commented in chat: I'm following and contributing to
  https://github.com/getlift/lift which cool way to bastract some complexity and
  built-in best practices
